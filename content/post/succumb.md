## Succumb  
Life seems to be about choices  
choices, there many are,  
in this glorious age of chemical effluence  
to succumb  
For a river my age, it's a choice of how to succumb  
(I am a river)  

To succumb to the plastic debris  
littering my banks, waiting to sink in  
and numerous as locusts in a swarm, decorate my floor  
like petals on a just-wed couple's wedding bed  
floating to the top, once in a while  
as if mocking human disregard  

To succumb to the sewage  
that has clogged my streams beyond the point  
it seems unworthy to even flow.  
Top it with the constant pressure to supply water  
It has left me wounded to the core  

To succumb to fertilizers, pesticides and such  
which mixes deep into my belly killing off  
precious plants and fish, leaving  
Swathes of water covered in algae that  
suck up the oxygen for plants and animals living in me  

To succumb to sand mining  
digging out the flesh of my withering body  
wriggling with pain, ready to spill over any time.  
Am I to blame for flooding my blanks?  
sand mining is afterall the great human construction endeavour  

An ode to civilization's glory  
of complete control over river waters.
