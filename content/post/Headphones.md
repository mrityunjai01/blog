## Headphones

look  
two lobes one bridge  
clung to my head, like a hook  
voices feeble  
yet sharp as the synth scale, water my barren ear.  

Blaring  
from the window, rubble of the morning,  
the air rustling, leaves singing autumn,  
fights, protests, and treet shows on roads.  
incorrigibly lost,  
my mind is aloof, it's clinched  
by Kacey in the midst of "Butterflies"  

They're my headphones, just before  
the first lecture of the day.  
Cradling me out of the cynical  
world, it shows me what privilege  
I've been given through generations.  

Not needing to speak, Not seeking to speak,  
Don't want to speak, stay apolitical.  
as Kids, we're told talking is for elders, never thinking  
what our elderhood holds for us.  

Dear headphone, tune me in  
to the ramblings of modern socio-political engine.  
my fellow co-citizens' cries, count me in  
when you play out academic lectures,  
but also wake me up when someone needs my efforts.
