## Mistakes
It's a D, stop staring like dumb  
it's my gradesheet. barely brushed flunk grade,    
Expectations apart, how am I supposed to respond when  
that's all I tried.  
They say it's your best you should do, not leaving chances for mistakes, but this is  
barely  
what I can relate to.  

Sinking into a dark tunnel  
feels familiar, or maybe it's another  
trail of guilt ridden wrist pinches  
a bed of scorpions eating your stomach from inside  
or just plain shame in letting myself think about it  

who's to blame?  
my cocky self aside, it's me  
yes, me  
who wants such dumbness fleeting around that too in the age of moral rationalism  
again, me  

It does make me cringe out when I think more of it  
fresh wounds, wounded again when dressing  
hiding it away, I walk along, never accepting  
what truly keeps me from healing those wounds  
the very refrain, my mind and my body feign  

Does it affect me? or rather make me more miserable?  
every other thing I do unbearable, liable to fail,  
Hence, undeserving of faithful try.  
what's the point when I know it's not worth the pain.  
Pain, it is,  
But only when prodded forward with an oar, it affects me.  
Or rather, kills me, my very intent to do little things zealously.


Don't get mad at me, I wouldn't have bothered talking otherwise.  
for my own healing  
I think this is time for me to peek inside.
