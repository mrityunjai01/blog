## Only one person can correctly interpret it as it is based off a personal anecdote. He knows that.
can you give me your code, if you like it as it is,  
just a java file, jittery  
with small classes and big functions, which I anyways  
don't care much about, after all  
it is the java file I need.  

The java file you dearly need, petrified  
the strings holding my skull together  
begging to guard the gray inside from  
hackling hundreds of lines hunting hidden errors.  
no replacement for hard work, I am stupefied.  

Months ago I wrested  
the course out of grading, audit!  
free from the shackles of studying  
gory algorithms and gangrenous data structures.  
Get me through the last gasp of breath.  

Audit, you might have done, though would not  
help you pass, the dementor wants to suck  
the joy out of your sub-30 course cremation.  
I still think I can help you,  
ought to do this for you.  

Without ado send the precious  
java file containing the subverted remains of neat code.  
Do not forget to change a bit,  
lest we are caught by turnitin, unconditionally.  
whenever you think it's done, send the holy grail.  

(after the marks are out)  

Celestial magic defies  
expectations, humble as it seems, "TRUE"  
the word stares back at me gaping  
The pastry has now been eaten by the flies.  
Calm on the outside, frantic inside, I call you.  

Let vague words not define our destiny, for  
we have done no wrong, it is  
only the TA's buffoonery  
Unleash the power of MOSS to test,  
MOSS be the sole judicator.  

(after MOSS results)  

Concoction of similarity,  
between your code and mine, for we  
think we stayed true and did our  
part well. MOSS has judged.  
all progress in the semester subverted.
