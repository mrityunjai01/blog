Most models can be thought of as random variables which are functions of some parameters (weights and biases). These weights and biases, combined with some random draws from fundamental distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Bernoulli), can be said to generate data. The combination of weights and draws from random distributions is called a model which is supposed to describe the relationship between inputs \\(x_i\\) and outputs \\(y_i\\). The goal of MLE is to find the parameters that maximize the likelihood of observing the given data \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\), where \\(i\\) comes from an indexing set.\nMLE not only provides estimates of the parameters (an estimate is a function of data observations \\(x_i\\) and \\(y_i\\), which is said to be equal in expectation to some function of \u0026ldquo;actual\u0026rdquo; population parameters), but also gives us some nice properties of the model.\nConsistency: As the sample size approaches infinity, the MLE converges in probability to the true parameter value. This means that with sufficiently large samples, the estimator will be arbitrarily close to the actual parameter. Asymptotic Normality Asymptotic Efficiency For these desirable properties to hold, several regularity conditions must be satisfied:\nIdentifiability: Different parameter values must produce different probability distributions. The mapping from parameters to distributions must be one-to-one.\nDifferentiability, Regularity of Support, Smoothness Conditions, Finite Fisher Information, Compact Parameter Space.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll focus on Identifiability and show that identifiability is not satisfied for most neural network architectures. We\u0026rsquo;ll try to ascertain, using an example, whether the MLE is consistent.\n"}]
