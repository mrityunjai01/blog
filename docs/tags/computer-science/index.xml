      <description>Only one person can correctly interpret it as it is based off a personal anecdote. He knows that. can you give me your code, if you like it as it is,

don&amp;rsquo;t care much about, after all
it is the java file I need.
The java file you dearly need, petrified
the strings holding my skull together</description>
