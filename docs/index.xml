      <description>It’s addressed from the POV of a cis male. The narrator (‘I’, a cis male) is talking about ‘you’ (a non cis male), who’s supposedly a colleague.
Vibrant as ever, my voice seeks to explain the working of the quantum mechanical treatment of a free particle The tone is calm, but assertive, as if my tongue drives the paddle of your mind. I&amp;rsquo;ve ended my speech with a short puff, waiting for approval.</description>

      <description>Succumb Life seems to be about choices
choices, there many are,
in this glorious age of chemical effluence
to succumb
For a river my age, it&amp;rsquo;s a choice of how to succumb
(I am a river)
To succumb to the plastic debris
littering my banks, waiting to sink in
and numerous as locusts in a swarm, decorate my floor
like petals on a just-wed couple&amp;rsquo;s wedding bed
floating to the top, once in a while</description>

      <description>Headphones look
two lobes one bridge
clung to my head, like a hook
voices feeble
yet sharp as the synth scale, water my barren ear.
Blaring
from the window, rubble of the morning,
the air rustling, leaves singing autumn,
fights, protests, and treet shows on roads.
incorrigibly lost,
my mind is aloof, it&amp;rsquo;s clinched
by Kacey in the midst of &amp;ldquo;Butterflies&amp;rdquo;
They&amp;rsquo;re my headphones, just before
the first lecture of the day.</description>

      <description>Only one person can correctly interpret it as it is based off a personal anecdote. He knows that. can you give me your code, if you like it as it is,
just a java file, jittery
with small classes and big functions, which I anyways
don&amp;rsquo;t care much about, after all
it is the java file I need.
The java file you dearly need, petrified
the strings holding my skull together</description>

      <description>Mistakes It&amp;rsquo;s a D, stop staring like dumb
it&amp;rsquo;s my gradesheet. barely brushed flunk grade, Expectations apart, how am I supposed to respond when
that&amp;rsquo;s all I tried.
They say it&amp;rsquo;s your best you should do, not leaving chances for mistakes, but this is
barely
what I can relate to.
Sinking into a dark tunnel
feels familiar, or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s another
trail of guilt ridden wrist pinches
a bed of scorpions eating your stomach from inside</description>
