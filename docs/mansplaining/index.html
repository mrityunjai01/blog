    <p><em>It’s addressed from the POV of a cis male. The narrator (‘I’, a cis male) is talking about ‘you’ (a non cis male), who’s supposedly a colleague.</em></p>
<p>Vibrant
as ever, my voice seeks to explain the working of the quantum mechanical treatment of a free particle
The tone is calm, but assertive, as if my tongue drives the paddle of your mind.
I&rsquo;ve ended my speech with a short puff, waiting for approval.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re headed
to the CSC lab, where you ask about the proxy configuration and I start reading the steps from the wall
dumbing it down so you understand it,
not long before I see that you&rsquo;ve finished all the steps before I&rsquo;m done with the first one, okay, you know how to read.</p>
<p>Different opinions
on things as innocuous as the way to fasten shoelace
strikingly different they may seem, give my mind the illusion of different intellect, mine the superior.
Has to be so, I generally have a better perspective on things being the more experienced guy I am.</p>
<p>Afterall, it&rsquo;s me
who knows the depths of the waters and can canoe the tough currents to help you fling across
the wall of imposed self deficiency that is spiked with societal reminders of male superiority
and laid with barbed wires of social etiquettes.</p>
<p>Free
In a sense that now makes me question freedom 
letting loose nothing that questions, elicits or creates reason for the things explained.
Does someone really want such explanations?</p>
<p>Being
better at everything makes anyone a bit cocky, doesn&rsquo;t it?
It&rsquo;s not me, or something I did, it&rsquo;s just the nature of the beast.
That shouldn&rsquo;t bother you, it&rsquo;s unasked for help, and it&rsquo;s best if you stay away from this mess.</p>
<p>Is it really a thing to be bothered about when you should accept my generosity by listening to me?
My way of doing things is better, my hand more experienced
even in things of your domain which somehow puts me defending my own capabilities.
Is it a manly thing to do?</p>
<p>Someday
shouldering the burden of this recurring need to show my abilities every time a non-male homo sapiens asks something
I stand in front of the mirror
this is not fair, I never signed up for this.</p>
<p>Problem
it is one that can&rsquo;t stay hidden everytime I meet you. There is weight to your perspective on things,
those things which don&rsquo;t occur to me the same way. There&rsquo;s definitely something amiss,
that&rsquo;s made me assume you&rsquo;re incapable of doing even basic things, which is surely not a good start.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve to accept
that you&rsquo;re as wise and as understanding as anyone else, not failing in any general capabilities
which should stop me pompously helping you in places where it&rsquo;s clear you don&rsquo;t need help.
I&rsquo;ve to burn my patronizing tone that snubs you when you&rsquo;re the one inch</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good
if we differ, there&rsquo;s nothing better than that. What I suppose is the best
is that I get to listen to your opinion, which is worthwhile for me to work on. It&rsquo;s worth
my respect, I&rsquo;d guarantee, this resounding orchestra, the parts and whole played to give beautiful sounds.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll sow it
deep inside my mind, letting it make me a better person who listens
to you, I&rsquo;ll take the cue and mould myself into the immaculateness of not talking down to people and heeding opinion,
eternally.</p>
